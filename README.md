# Introduction

This program demonstrates a playable browser based tic tac toe game. User
authentication is required to play. Requirements provided by General
Assembly's Web Development Immersive program.

## Technologies Used

- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Node.js
- Webpack
- Grunt
- Git, Github.com, and GitHub Pages

## Development Process

1. Plan wireframes and user stories
2. Brainstorm data structures
3. Create git branches for version control: master, html/css, api, logic, etc
4. Tackle HTML first to give a graphical UI
5. Create functionality for Sign up/in/out and change password buttons (auth)
6. Develop game engine and logic
7. Develop API functionality on locally hosted server
8. Switch all console logs to user readable on screen messages.
9. Develop ReadMe.md file!

## Problem Solving Strategy

I console.log() all valuable data for testing purposes as I code, and add/commit
changes as soon as the correct results are appearing. My work flow was most
consistent with javascript, as I am most familiar with it. API functions and
css proved to be more difficult. To ease the pain I would continually walk
through all function calls from the first click to understand the flow of the
API and the locally hosted server. Being able to read the HTTP codes was very
helpful for making sure my API functionality was correct.

## Unsolved Problems

- Play over multiple devices.
- Uncaught token error when not signed in.
- Lacking pretty css styling/colors/fonts (still usable however)

## User Stories

-As a user I can sign up, sign in, sign out, and change Password
-As a user I can create X and O markers on the board
-As a user I can win, lose, or tie the game
-As a user I can see how many games I have played
-As a user I will know intuitively how to use the interface
